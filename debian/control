Description: oneAPI Level Zero Ray Tracing Support library
 A library that provides high-performance CPU-based construction algorithms for
 3D acceleration structures, designed to work with the ray tracing hardware of
 Intel GPUs. Intel(R) oneAPI Level Zero uses this library to implement the Ray
 Tracing Acceleration Structures (RTAS) builder extension. The library is
 intended for use exclusively through Level Zero and is not meant to be accessed
 directly.
